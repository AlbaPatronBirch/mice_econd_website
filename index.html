    <h2>Monday</h2>
    <p>
        On Monday I got a tour of the offices. I think the Amazon offices here in Edinburgh are very nice cause they've got lot of amenities such as free tea and coffee in the kitchens and pool tables by the dining area. We then went on to do some paired programming with an apprentice and I learnt my first bits of code. Overall, I had a very nice day, I then went on to sit in the gsrdens nearby for a bit cause it was nice and sunny.
